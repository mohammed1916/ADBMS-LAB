        "The traceback indicates an AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith' within the `fetch_image` function in `unsloth_zoo/vision_utils.py`. This suggests that an image source being passed to `fetch_image` is `None` instead of a string (like a URL or file path) or a PIL Image object. Looking at the traceback, this likely originates from processing the 'messages' in the dataset within the data collator. The `process_vision_info` function seems to be extracting vision information, and it's possible that in some samples, the 'image' or 'image_url' field within the content is missing or is `None`. The preprocessing function we created for the CIFAR-10 dataset does use a PIL Image object, so this error might be due to how that image object is being handled or if some samples were not correctly processed and contain `None` where an image should be. To fix this, I will inspect the `processed_dataset` to ensure that the 'messages' column contains valid image objects and not `None` values where images are expected. I will print a few samples from the `processed_dataset` to verify the structure and content, specifically looking at the 'content' list within the user message to check the 'image' field.\n",

This indicates that `FastVisionModel.from_pretrained` might not support loading from a local directory directly in the way attempted, or there's a specific format it expects for local paths. Looking at the previous successful code cell where the model was saved (`model.save_pretrained(\"lora_model\")`), the saving process completed without error. The error message suggests `from_pretrained` is still trying to interpret the local path as a Hugging Face repository ID. I need to investigate how `unsloth` handles loading locally saved models or if there's an alternative loading mechanism for LoRA adapters saved locally. Since the goal is to evaluate the finetuned model, and loading the saved model is a prerequisite, I need to figure out the correct way to load the local LoRA adapters.

        "The previous attempt to load the base model failed with a `ValueError` related to memory and device mapping during quantization. The error message \"Some modules are dispatched on the CPU or the disk. Make sure you have enough GPU RAM to fit the quantized model\" indicates that the model is too large to fit entirely in GPU memory even with 4-bit quantization, and the default device mapping is attempting to offload parts to the CPU or disk, which is not supported in this configuration without specific offloading settings. Since the goal is to evaluate the finetuned model (which is a LoRA adapter on top of this base model), I need to load the base model in a way that fits in memory. The error message suggests passing a custom `device_map` or setting `llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload=True`. However, `unsloth`'s `FastVisionModel` is designed to handle memory efficiently with 4-bit loading and its own device mapping. The error might stem from conflicts with the default `transformers` quantization and device mapping logic when used within `unsloth`. I will try loading the base model again using `FastVisionModel.from_pretrained`, ensuring `load_in_4bit=True` is set, and explicitly setting `device_map=\"auto\"` to let `transformers` handle the device placement, hoping `unsloth`'s optimizations work correctly with this setting. If this still fails, it suggests a fundamental memory issue with loading this specific model on the available hardware, and I may need to acknowledge failure for this subtask.\n",

        "*   A placeholder dataset (CIFAR-10) was used to simulate paired images and demonstrate the preprocessing logic for a vision-to-text model. The preprocessing function successfully created a \"messages\" column in a conversational format, including text and image content for the user role and placeholder text for the assistant role.\n",

        "*   Attempts to finetune the model failed due to an `AttributeError` during data loading, caused by an incorrect structure in the processed dataset where text content items in the \"messages\" field erroneously contained `{'image': None}`. This issue persisted despite attempts to correct the preprocessing function.\n",
        "*   Evaluation of the model failed because the base model \"unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B\" could not be loaded due to insufficient GPU memory (14.741 GB available). This prevented the loading of LoRA adapters and subsequent inference steps.\n",

        "*   To proceed with finetuning and evaluation, a computing environment with sufficient GPU memory to load the chosen base model (\"unsloth/gemma-3n-E4B\" requires more than 14.741 GB) is necessary, or an alternative, smaller vision-language model should be used.\n"
